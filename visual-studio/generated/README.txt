These files are normally generated automatically by the Unix-based
build system. Because the tools necessary to generate them (notably
perl) are not present on the majority of Windows systems, they are
included here. If any changes are made to the corresponding .asm
files, these files need to be regenerated (probably under a Unix
operating system or equivalent, such as Cygwin) and updated.
