Changes since 0.9.4:

  - Changes to the synchronization model for compartment and state
    reference counting to prevent certain kinds of concurrency
    problems.

Changes since 0.9.3:

  - Fixed relatively obscure bug in Deflate compressor which would
    cause incorrect calculation of generated state (and consequent
    decompression failures) for certain large messages

  - Added "configure" script to aid in setting up the build
    environment properly

  - Fixed bad interaction between assembly scripts and perl 5.8.0

  - Added checking to stack to prevent core dumps when the application
    passes in a null pointer to a SigComp message

  - Added parameters to the StateHandler that allow the application to
    instruct the stack to assume minimum values of parameters (state
    memory storage, etc) higher than those required by RFC 3320.

  - Some endian-ness fixes for ARMv4 Windows Mobile devices built
    with the Visual Studio 2005 compiler

  - Optimized COPY-OFFSET opcode to execute in O(1) instead of O(n)

  - Fixed complation issues with use of usleep in test drivers on
    certain platforms

Changes since 0.9.2:

  - Added "make install" target to copy library and header files
    to a common location.

  - Modified primary interfaces towards application to take
    void* instead of byte_t*; this eliminates a lot of arbitrary
    casting in the application.

  - A few const fixups in the application API

  - Pruned file dependency tree back significantly

  - A number of modifications to eliminate ABI changes when compiling
    the library with different macros defined. This should eliminate
    the requirement that the library and the application are compiled
    with the same macros defined

  - Additional changes to support Microsoft eMbedded Visual C++ 4,
    MinGW, MS Visual Studio 2005

Changes since 0.9.1:

  - Fixed a bug in assembler that would cause an infinite loop
    when the byte and word constructs were used to insert literal
    bytes and words

  - Several changes to support Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0
