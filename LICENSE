The Open SigComp library is freely available under version 2 of the Gnu
General Public License (GPL), a copy of which is available in the file
"COPYING". We have released the library under the GPL in hopes that it can
be of use for research, prototyping, and advancing the SigComp standard.

Software distributed under the GPL is appropriate for use in prototypes,
research, and other open source projects that use the GPL or a compatible
license. The GPL does not prohibit use in a commercial product, but
please be familiar with and comply with all GPL provisions concerning the
redistribution of software that incorporates or links with Open SigComp.

Estacado Systems offers an enhanced compression library based on Open
SigComp. Please send email to info@estacado.net for more information.

Additionally, there are certain components of the library that are
covered by patents (such as advanced compression algorithms). Because
these components require licensing from the holders of such patents, they
are not released as open source. To take advantage of such components,
you must obtain a non-open-source license from Estacado Systems.

Finally, Estacado Systems grants specific permission to link the Open
SigComp library with the reSIProcate library and the Open SSL library. Any
products using Open SigComp linked with the either of these libraries,
however, are still subject to the terms of the GPL.
